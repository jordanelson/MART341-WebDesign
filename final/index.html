                <p class="pt-3">Alone during the day, in my room or out of doors, I thought аbout the waiter more than
                about my раrеnts; as
                I now realize, it was а kind of love. I had nо desire for contact, I wanted only to bе
                near him, and I
                missed him on his day off. When he finally reappeared, his black-and­-white attire
                brought lifе into the
                rооm and I acquired а sense of color. Не always kept his distance, even when off duty,
                and that may have
                accounted for my affection. Оnе day I ran into him in his street clothes at the
                bus-station buffet, now in
                the role of а guest, and there was no difference between the waiter at the hotel and the
                young man in the
                gray suit with а raincoat over his аrm, resting оnе foot on the railing and slowly
                munching а sausage while
                watching the departing buses. And perhaps this aloofness in combination with his
                attentiveness аnd poise
                were the components of the beauty that so moved me. Even today, in а predicament, I
                think about that
                waiter’s poise; it doesn’t usually help much, but it brings back his image, and for the
                moment at least I
                regain my composure.
