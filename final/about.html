        <p>You don’t even need to see what’s around the next bend to be stopped in your tracks at Glacier National Park.
        The sheer beauty is jaw dropping from every angle. With over 1 million acres of towering, jagged peaks, cascading
        waterfalls, wild meadows and sparkling waters, plus wildlife watching and recreation opportunities, it is, quite
        simply, the vacation of a lifetime. The raw splendor of glacial-carved terrain is unlike any other place on earth.
        There’s something to be said about climbing high enough to actually see as far as the eye can see. And when you
        experience that kind of vastness in Glacier National Park, it’s not something you’ll soon—or ever—forget.
        Glacier National Park has one of the largest intact ecosystems in the temperate zone, and it's surprisingly easy
        to explore by road or trail. The Going-to-the-Sun Road—an engineering marvel and National Historic Landmark—takes
        visitors through the heart of the park over Logan Pass and is one of the most scenic drives in North America.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          And while summer is the park’s busiest season, it’s open—and lovely—year-round. Autumn offers quiet exploration
          among golden hues and prime wildlife viewing. Winter in the park is prime for snowshoeing, ice climbing,
          cross-country skiing and sightseeing, and springtime offers an opportunity to take advantage of a vehicle-free
          bicycle ride up the Going-to-the-Sun Road.

            Glacier National Park is home to 26 glaciers, down from approximately 150 in 1850. That number is expected
            to continue its rapid decline as climate changes shrink their size, according to the US Geological Survey
            (USGS). Of the existing glaciers, the largest is Harrison Glacier, at 1.6 million square meters.

            There are a whopping 762 lakes in Glacier National Park, 131 of which are named. The largest lake in the
            park is Lake McDonald, at 9.4 miles long, 1.5 miles wide, and 464 feet deep. While Lake McDonald isn't
            considered a prime fishing lake, visitors flock to catch a sight of the many wild animals that live along
            its shore, including moose, black bears, and mule deer. The park is also home to 2,865 miles of streams,
            the longest of which is Upper McDonald Creek at 25.8 miles.

            Plant and animal species thrive in Glacier National Park, with 71 species of mammals, 276 species of birds,
            and 1,990 total species of plants documented. Wildlife tours are popular among visitors, and sightings are
            frequent in the warmer spring and summer months. There are a total of 175 mountains in Glacier National Park,
            the tallest of which is Mt. Cleveland at 10,448 feet. Logan Pass, the highest point on the Going-to-the-Sun Road,
            located along the Continental Divide, comes in at 6,646 feet.
