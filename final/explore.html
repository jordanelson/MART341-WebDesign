          Adventures in and around Glacier National Park often begin and end in West Glacier.
          As the western gateway to Glacier National Park, West Glacier has been dubbed "guide central."
          Local guides offer hiking and fly-fishing trips, whitewater and scenic rafting excursions, backcountry
          camping and trail rides. This bustling community has Montana-minded shops, great local dining and numerous
          accommodations, as well as a golf course with great views and affordable rates. Quieter during winter,
          West Glacier does offer lodging during the park's slower season.

          East Glacier Park is the perfect place to begin a Western Montana adventure. As one of the gateways to
          Glacier National Park, this community is authentically down-to-earth, complete with friendly locals
          serving up home-cooked meals, coveted huckleberry ice cream and insider tips on area attractions. Located
          on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, East Glacier Park and the surrounding area have cultural and historical
          significance to the Blackfeet Tribe. Fun Fact: All nine holes of the local golf course are named after former
          chiefs of the Blackfeet Nation.

            Apgar is made up of several developed areas and facilities at the south end of Lake McDonald, each connected
            with one another by Camas Road, Apgar Loop Road, and a bike path. The area includes the lakefront village,
            the separate visitor center, a lakefront picnic area, short hiking trails, and the park’s largest campground.

          Where Going-to-the-Sun Road crosses over the Continental Divide at 6646 feet (2025 m) elevation, Logan Pass is the
          highest spot in the park accessible by vehicle. It’s extremely popular, and its parking lot fills very early and
          remains busy throughout the day. A series of exhibits behind the Logan Pass Visitor Center explain, using enjoyable,
          comic book-style art, how climate change is making survival more challenging for some animals.

          Lower portions of Going-to-the-Sun Road are open year-round, but the upper elevations do not usually open until late June.
          Please visit our Plowing and Road Status pages for the most up-to-date information. The alpine sections of the road typically
          close for the winter on the third Monday of October, but this can change due to wintry weather.

          Built to resemble a rustic hunting chalet with Swiss luxury influence, the historic lodge itself is an attraction. The property
          also houses other historic buildings, including a separate camp store and multiple dining options. The dock provides access to
          lake tours and boat rentals, and several popular hiking trails begin at the Sperry trailhead located just across the road.

          Accessed via a separate entrance just northwest of the town of East Glacier Park, the Two Medicine area is a popular alternative
          to the Going-to-the-Sun Road corridor. The valley’s west end features a large, high-elevation lake surrounded by dramatic peaks
          and plenty of hiking trails.
