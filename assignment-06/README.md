1. A page can have one of each main document head and body elements. These elements differ because the head contains high-level information and it comes first within the root element. The body element comes after the head in the root element and contains the data that is rendered and displayed on the computer.

2. The difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural markup includes the foundational aspects of a document and semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information in a document.

3. For this assignment I took it step by step and made sure each part was done correctly before moving on to the next portion of the assignment. I double checked by going back and forth between Atom and Github.
